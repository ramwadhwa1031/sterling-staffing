                    <div class="divider my-4"></div>
                    <ul>
                        <li>You use the service at your own risk. We provide the service "as is," "with all faults," and "as available." We, our content providers, and other suppliers ("Service Providers") make no express warranties or guarantees about the Service. We care about the integrity and security of your personal information.

To the extent permitted by law, we and the service providers disclaim implied warranties that the service is merchantable, of satisfactory quality, accurate, fit for a particular purpose or need, or non-infringing. NEITHER WE NOR THE SERVICE PROVIDERS GUARANTEE THAT THE RESULTS THAT MAY BE OBTAINED FROM THE USE OF THE SERVICE, INCLUDING ANY SUPPORT SERVICES, WILL BE EFFECTIVE, RELIABLE, ACCURATE, MEET YOUR TASTES, OR MEET YOUR REQUIREMENTS. NEITHER WE NOR THE SERVICE PROVIDERS GUARANTEE THAT YOU WILL BE ABLE TO ACCESS OR USE THE SERVICE (EITHER DIRECTLY OR THROUGH THIRD-PARTY NETWORKS) AT THE TIMES OR LOCATIONS OF YOUR CHOOSING. No oral or written information or advice given by our representatives shall create a warranty. You may have additional consumer rights under your local laws that this contract cannot change.</li>
                        <li>NEITHER WE NOR THE SERVICE PROVIDERS SHALL BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES ARISING FROM YOUR USE OF THE SERVICE. THESE EXCLUSIONS APPLY TO ANY CLAIMS FOR LOST PROFITS, LOST DATA, LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF WE OR THE SERVICE PROVIDERS KNEW OR SHOULD HAVE KNOWN THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THE SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY AVAILABLE TO YOU FOR ANY OF THE ABOVE CLAIMS OR ANY DISPUTE WITH Sterling Staffing LTD RELATING TO THE WEBSITE OR THE SERVICE IS TO IMMEDIATELY DISCONTINUE USE OF THE SERVICE. BECAUSE SOME STATES OR JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR THE LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, IN SUCH STATES OR JURISDICTIONS, AND IF FOR ANY REASON ENGLAND LAW IS NOT APPLICABLE, THE SERVICE PROVIDERS’ LIABILITY IN SUCH A STATE OR JURISDICTION IS LIMITED TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>INDEMNIFICATION</h4>
                    <div class="divider my-4"></div>
                    <p>Upon a request by us, you agree to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless Sterling Staffing LTD and our subsidiaries, owners, and other affiliates, and our and their employees, licensees, service providers, and our and their respective owners, representatives, employees, contractors, officers, and directors from all liabilities, claims, and expenses, including attorney’s fees, that arise from your use or misuse of the service. We reserve the right, at our own expense, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter otherwise subject to indemnification by you, in which event you will cooperate with us in asserting any available defenses.</p>
                    <h4>ELECTRONIC CONTRACTING AND NOTICES</h4>
                    <div class="divider my-4"></div>
                    <p>Your affirmative act of using or registering for our service constitutes your electronic signature to these Terms of Use and your consent to enter into Terms of Use with us electronically. We may send to you in electronic form any privacy or other notices, disclosures, reports, documents, communications, or other records regarding the Service (collectively, "Notices"). We may send you electronic notices (1) to the e-mail address that you provided to us during registration, (2) to any e-mail account you open with a service, or (3) by posting the notice on the applicable service. The delivery of any notice from us is effective when sent by us, regardless of whether you read the notice when you receive it or whether you receive the delivery. You can withdraw your consent to receive notices electronically by canceling or discontinuing your use of the applicable service.</p>
                    <h4>CHOICE OF LAW AND LOCATION FOR RESOLVING DISPUTES</h4>
                    <div class="divider my-4"></div>
                    <p>The laws of England govern this contract and any claim or dispute that you may have against us, without regard to England’s conflict of laws rules, and the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods shall have no applicability. Any controversy or claim arising out of or relating to these Terms of Use, or the breach hereof, will be settled by binding arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association under its Commercial Arbitration Rules, and judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. The arbitration will take place in England before a single arbitrator. Notwithstanding the foregoing, you or Sterling Staffing LTD may seek injunctive relief from an appropriate court located in England before or during the arbitration. Enforcement and/or any action related to the decision of the arbitrator or enforcement of these Terms of Use are governed by the jurisdiction of courts located in England.</p>
                    <p>By agreeing to this agreement, you are: (1) waiving claims that you might otherwise have against us based on the laws of jurisdictions other than England, including your own; (2) irrevocably consenting to the exclusive jurisdiction of and venue in state and federal courts in the state of England over any disputes or claims you have with us; (3) submitting yourself to binding arbitration in Los Angeles, England to resolve any such disputes or claims; and (4) knowingly and willingly waiving any right to a jury trial or trial by judge.</p>
                    
                    <h4>MISCELLANEOUS</h4>
                    <div class="divider my-4"></div>
                    <p>We may assign this contract at any time without notice to you. You may not assign this contract to anyone else. Our subsidiaries, owners, and other affiliates, and our and their employees, licensees, Service Providers, and their respective owners, representatives, employees, contractors, officers, and directors are express third-party beneficiaries of these Terms of Use and may (subject to our agreements with them) enforce their rights against you under these Terms of Use. Our failure to exercise or enforce any right or provision of the Terms of Use shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. These Terms of Use, the Privacy Policy, and the policies, rules, and guidelines posted on the Website constitute the entire contract between you and us regarding the Service and supersede all previous written or oral contracts. If any part of these Terms of Use is held invalid or unenforceable, that portion shall be construed in a manner consistent with applicable law to reflect, as nearly as possible, the original intentions of the parties, and the remaining portions shall remain in full force and effect.</p>
